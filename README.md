# PPDS assignment 4 - Dining savages
At this assignment we deal dining savages problem.


## Dining savages problem
_Dining savages_ problem is analogy based on savages who share one pot. The pot contains a certain number of portions of food and savages can take from it as long as it is not empty.
When the pot is empty, the savage must tell the cook(s) to fill it up again so that the savages can eat again until there is food.[^1]

## Our implementation requirements
- The savages begin to dine all together. They start eating when the last one arrives.
- Savage always get one portion at a time, until the pot is empty.
- When the savage discovers that the pot is empty, he calls the cooks to cook.
- Savages are waiting for the whole pot to be filled.
- The cook always cooks and puts to pot one portion at a time.
- When the pot is full, savages continue to eat.
- The process is repeated endlessly.
