# PPDS assigment 2 - Barber shop
In this assigment we deal _sleeping barber_ problem with possible customer overrun.
## Sleeping barber problem
_Sleeping barber_ problem is analogy based on barbershop with one barber who cuts only one customer's hair at a time and waiting room with N seats.
The barber sleeps if he has no customers and the next customer has to wake him up. When she starts cutting, other customers have to wait in the waiting room and if it fills up, they have to leave.[^1]
